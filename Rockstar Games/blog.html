                <h3>"Aromatic Adventures: Explore Our Coffee Blogs"</h3>
                <p>As a student, I have eaten lots of food in cafeteria and I am thinking that it is not that much expensive for students. What would you rather eat at lunch, your home-made lunch or food from cafeteria? The cafeteria offers student many different kinds of food, for example, pizza, French fries, chicken burger, etc. However, the food of cafeteria is not that much expensive for students. The cafeteria is not taking much of a profit from students and also the food that they are selling in the cafeteria is also very healthy. If there is no cafeteria, student could just go outside the campus and eat unhealthy and cheap food. Since there is cafeteria in campus, they should start balancing the price with students a bit more. BUBT have well spacious cafeteria with necessary facilities. The cafeteria has well organized sitting and food arrangements for the students. Besides, it has Teachersâ€™ Lounge for the faculty members where they can have their snacks and lunch and read newspapers as well. Different kinds of snacks including fast food and traditional foods are available in BUBT cafeteria. Besides, breakfast and lunch are also available here. All the food items are highly hygienic and are monitored regularly by the authority. Besides, the food items are also available with minimum price. The cafeterias are air-conditioned and have high speed wi-fi facility. Besides, it has separate newspaper reading facilities for the teachers and students. It has indoor games facilities for the students such as, table tennis, badminton, chess, ludo, etc. </p>
